# HuffmanCoding

Implementation of Huffman tree encoding. 
The output from Huffman's algorithm can be viewed as a variable-length code table for encoding a source symbol (such as a character in a file). 
The algorithm derives this table from the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence (weight) for each possible value of the source symbol.
As in other entropy encoding methods, more common symbols are generally represented using fewer bits than less common symbols. 
Huffman's method can be efficiently implemented, finding a code in time linear to the number of input weights if these weights are sorted.
